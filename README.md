# OpenGL_with_Python
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

Note: If you use MACOS, you need to change "fullName" line with "fullName = "/System/Library/Frameworks/{}.framework/{}".format(name,name)" in ctypesloader.py file in site_packages/OpenGL/platform
